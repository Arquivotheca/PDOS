; Note that the string as it currently stands is exactly the
; right size to fit into "ldwin" peigen.c. And note that
; "od -t x4" on needpdos.exe will generate hex values suitable
; for updating peigen.c. So you can change the string but not
; make it bigger. Unless you change other stuff as well.

; I am suspicious about how this DGROUP gets set. Although it seems
; to work, it appears as x'0000' in the executable, so it must be
; dependent on being relocated. But we don't want relocations to
; be done, as we are only changing the code, not the header. So
; switching DS (pointing to PSP) to CS is the right thing to do.

; No need for a return. We're screwed anyway if the above

/ void inthdlr(void);
/
/ handling interrupts is very complex.  here is an example:
/
/ command.com, 0x30 does int 21 to exec pgm world
/ interrupt saves esp into saveesp
/ then a load is done, clobbering saveesp, but not before saving it,
/ although since it was already 0x10 it doesn't need to be saved in this case
/ then world is executed, which does an int 21 to do a print
/ it saves the old saveesp onto the stack, puts the new esp into saveesp,
/ then there is a bios call, but it doesn't do anything since ss is already
/ 0x10.  then the interrupt ends, restoring saveesp

/ _inthdlr is the default interrupt handler designed to do nothing.
/ It sets the interrupt number to 0xff for recognition by gotint.

/ This is for interrupts that should not alter

/ by the time we get here, the following things are on the stack:
/ original eax, original ds (stored as doubleword), original intnum

/ And because this is an interrupt that does not push an error
/ code, above those 3 dwords are the EIP, cs (stored as a
/ dword), and the flags (also stored as a dword). All three of
/ those things will be popped when we do an iret.

/ Above that is completely unpredictable, as it is just whatever
/ the application had pushed onto the stack before the
/ interrupt occurred.

/ gotint() will receive the interrupt plus an array of registers.
/ It will then pass it on to the specific interrupt handler, just
/ passing the register array. This pointer is all that the
/ interrupt will have to work with, so we need to calculate
/ everything from that spot.

/ In addition, the stack is actually switched (to the caller's
/ stack, but with the OS (0x10) ss) prior to the register array
/ being constructed. I think
/ this switch is done to allow the interrupt to terminate the
/ called program if it wishes to do so. The stack pointer before
/ the switch is available on the new stack, after the registers
/ (EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI) then cflag, then flags. Although
/ at time of writing, the flags are not being correctly passed
/ up to gotint().

/ We don't switch stack if this is the highest level, ie ss of 0x10
/ Note that when an application is running it will have an ss of
/ 0x30 which is "spawn_data"

/ old stack looks like this at the time of stack switch:
/ unpredictable stack data pushed by application during execution,
/ before interruption
/ flags
/ cs
/ eip
/ eax
/ ds
/ old intnum
/ previous interrupt's ss (saveess)
/ previous interrupt's esp (saveesp)
/ ebx (not sure why it is needed, seems to do with flags)
/ previous interrupt's eax (saveeax)
/ previous interrupt's ebx (saveebx)
/ The above is what saveesp will be pointing to
/ ebp is temporarily stored here, and will remain if there is a
/     stack switch done

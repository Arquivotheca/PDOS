bios.exe is a BIOS that exports various functions in the
C library, starting with a bodged printf for now. There
is an AmigaOS version (currently dependent on having
a 68020 or above unless you rebuild using your own
68000 C compiler). Use makefile.ami to build. Use
compbios.bat to build a Windows version. Use allmvs.bat
to build an MVS version.

osworld.exe is a 68000 (not 68020) program that depends
on a suitable BIOS such as the above. Although it is in
AmigaOS hunk format, it will not be possible to run it
from AmigaOS but maybe a future version of AmigaPDOS
would support this interface (or something similar) for
application programs, but it would probably need a different
identifier, probably 00000F3F instead of 000003F3. It
especially makes a difference whether
AmigaPDOS is being built to run AmigaOS executables or
whether AmigaPDOS has been built to run its own standard
for executables, which would require a different format
so that it can identify the processor, the size of char,
short etc, so that it can adjust program arguments
appropriately and switch to a different coprocessor if
required. I used compami.bat to build. You can also
build an 80386 a.out executable with comppdos.bat and
the MVS version is built as part of the above.

Run by going:

bios.exe osworld.exe

on any AmigaOS system, with a 68020 or above unless you
have compiled your own bios.exe. The reason it has been
built using 68020 instructions is because I don't yet
have public domain 68000 assembler code (or even C code)
to do 32-bit division as needed by the compiler I am
currently using (vbcc). Same deal for running on
Windows, and MVS is done as part of the above.

See exeloadLoadAmiga() in exeload.c for copious documentation
on how everything should work. Special thanks to Frank Wille
for running tests on AmigaOS for me, and even running a
debugger over my executable to find out what I was doing
wrong. Also to the guys over at http://eab.abime.net/ for
patiently explaining how AmigaOS worked and where a BIOS
fitted in, and Commodore also for providing an inspiration
(OS accessed via absolute location 4) for a BIOS that operated
in a similar manner.
